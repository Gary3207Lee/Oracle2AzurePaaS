</br>

## **Migration**

In online (minimal-downtime) migrations, the migration source continues to change. It drifts from the target in terms of data and schema after the one-time migration.
</br>
During the Data sync phase, ensure that all changes in the source are captured and applied to the target in near real time. After you verify that all changes are applied, you can cut over from the source to the target environment.
</br>

In a delta/incremental migration that uses [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-factory/), for each table, use a query that filters (cuts) by date, time, or another parameter. Then finish the migration by using a second query that migrates the remaining data.

  - PGAdmin
    - Download
      - Download [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/).
    - Schema Migration
      - You can simply run exported DDL scripts with PGAdmin on Target PostgreSQL database.</br>
      </br>
  - Ora2PG
    - Schema Migration
      - You can use [Ora2PG command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/migrate/how-to-migrate-from-oracle#compile-files) to compile exported DDLs.

- **Useful Tips for Migration**
  - Oracle consider char(0) as a null value and PostgreSQL doesn't accept char(0) or '' value. You need to filter those value before the migration.
  - Avoid exporting tables with their foreign keys (FKs), constraints, and indexes. These elements slow down the process of importing data into PostgreSQL. </br>
