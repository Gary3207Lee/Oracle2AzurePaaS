## **Assessment**

To assess the migration cost, ora2pg checks all database objects, functions, and stored procedures for objects and PL/SQL code that it can't automatically convert.

The ora2pg tool has a content analysis mode that inspects the Oracle database to generate a text report. The report describes what the Oracle database contains and what can't be exported.
