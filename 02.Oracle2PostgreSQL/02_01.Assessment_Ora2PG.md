## **Assessment**

To assess the migration cost, ora2pg checks all database objects, functions, and stored procedures for objects and PL/SQL code that it can't automatically convert.

The ora2pg tool has a content analysis mode that inspects the Oracle database to generate a text report. The report describes what the Oracle database contains and what can't be exported.
</br>

To activate the analysis and report mode, use the exported type SHOW_REPORT as shown in the following command:
<pre>
<code>
ora2pg -t SHOW_REPORT
</code>
</pre>
</br>

To estimate the migration cost in human-days, ora2pg allows you to use a configuration directive called ESTIMATE_COST. You can also enable this directive at a command prompt:
<pre>
<code>
ora2pg -t SHOW_REPORT --estimate_cost
</code>
</pre>
</br>

In the following code example, you see some assessment variations:

- Tables assessment
- Columns assessment
- Schema assessment that uses a default cost unit of 5 minutes
- Schema assessment that uses a cost unit of 10 minutes

<pre>
<code>
ora2pg -t SHOW_TABLE -c c:\ora2pg\ora2pg_hr.conf > c:\ts303\hr_migration\reports\tables.txt 
ora2pg -t SHOW_COLUMN -c c:\ora2pg\ora2pg_hr.conf > c:\ts303\hr_migration\reports\columns.txt
ora2pg -t SHOW_REPORT -c c:\ora2pg\ora2pg_hr.conf --dump_as_html --estimate_cost > c:\ts303\hr_migration\reports\report.html
ora2pg -t SHOW_REPORT -c c:\ora2pg\ora2pg_hr.conf â€“-cost_unit_value 10 --dump_as_html --estimate_cost > c:\ts303\hr_migration\reports\report2.html
</code>
</pre>
</br>

Here's the output of the schema assessment migration level:

Migration levels:

A - Migration that can be run automatically

B - Migration with code rewrite and a human-days cost up to 5 days

C - Migration with code rewrite and a human-days cost over 5 days

Technical levels:

1 = Trivial: No stored functions and no triggers

2 = Easy: No stored functions, but triggers; no manual rewriting

3 = Simple: Stored functions and/or triggers; no manual rewriting

4 = Manual: No stored functions, but triggers or views with code rewriting

5 = Difficult: Stored functions and/or triggers with code rewriting

The assessment consists of:

A letter (A or B) to specify whether the migration needs manual rewriting.

A number from 1 to 5 to indicate the technical difficulty.
