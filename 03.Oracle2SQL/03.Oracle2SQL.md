## **SSMA for Oracle**

Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle is a tool for migrating Oracle databases to MicrosoftSQL Server 2012, MicrosoftSQL Server 2014, MicrosoftSQL Server 2016, MicrosoftSQL Server 2017 on Windows and Linux, MicrosoftSQL Server 2019 on Windows and Linux, and Azure SQL Database. SSMA for Oracle converts Oracle database objects to SQL Server database objects, creates those objects in SQL Server, and then migrates data from Oracle to SQL Server.

## **Discover**

The goal of the discovery phase is to identify existing data sources and details about the features that are being used. This phase helps you better understand and plan for the migration. The process involves scanning the network to identify all your organization's Oracle instances together with the version and features in use.
</br>

Microsoft pre-assessment scripts for Oracle run against the Oracle database. The pre-assessment scripts query the Oracle metadata. The scripts provide:

- A database inventory, including counts of objects by schema, type, and status.
- A rough estimate of the raw data in each schema, based on statistics.
- The size of tables in each schema.
- The number of code lines per package, function, procedure, and so on.
- To improve the performance of the assessment or export operations in the Oracle server, collect statistics:
</br>

<pre>
<code>
BEGIN

   DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS
   DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DATABASE_STATS
   DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS
   END;
</code>
</pre>
</br>

- You can utilize **Microsoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit** to identify existing data sources and details about the features your organization is using. This process involves scanning the network to identify all your organization's Oracle instances, versions, and features. </br>
- To use the **MAP Toolkit** to perform an inventory scan, please refer to this [**guide document**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/migrate/guides/oracle-to-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#discover).
</br>

</br>

## **Assessment**

Before you load objects and migrate data to SQL Server, you should determine how complex the migration will be and how much time the migration will take. SSMA can create an assessment report that shows the percentage of objects that will be successfully converted. SSMA also lets you view the specific issues that cause conversion failures.

</br>

</br>

## **Convert**

After you have connected to Oracle, connected to SQL Server, and set project and data mapping options, you can convert Oracle database objects to SQL Server database objects.

### **Tips**

- In Oracle there is CLOB & BLOB data type holding **4 GB** data Max, but in SQL there is the limitations up to **2GB**.
  SQL Managed Instance doesn't support [filestream](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/blob/filestream-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16). This means, you need to save BLOB data in Storage Account and need to develop on application side to handle data. (Database can keep file location on the table and app need to access storage account based on the location information.)
- Oracle XMLTYPE store XML data and alternative for SQL Server is XML. XMLTYPE datatype in Oracle can handle **6 GB** but SQL XML datatype can handle up to **2 GB**.
  This means, you need to save BLOB data in Storage Account and need to develop on application side to handle data. (Database can keep file location on the table and app need to access storage account based on the location information.)
- You can leverage below script for account migration.

<pre>
<code>
SELECT 'USE MASTER 
GO 
CREATE LOGIN ' || USERNAME || ' WITH PASSWORD = ''<Temporary Password>'' 
GO 
USE ' || USERNAME || ' 
GO 
CREATE USER ' || USERNAME || ' FOR LOGIN ' || USERNAME || ' 
GO'
FROM DBA_USERS
WHERE USERNAME NOT IN ('SYS', 'SYSTEM', 'ANONYMOUS')
AND ACCOUNT_STATUS = 'OPEN';
</code>
</pre>

- SSMA support Oracle range partition. please refer to the [demo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/data-exposed/migrating-to-sql-enabling-automatic-conversions-for-partitioned-tables-ep5) and [document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/partitions/create-partitioned-tables-and-indexes?view=sql-server-ver16) for [SQL Server Partion and Index](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/partitions/partitioned-tables-and-indexes?view=sql-server-ver16).

## **Migrate**

</br>

### **Migrate Schema**

When you've made the necessary fixes, a stable build of the database is ready to deploy. You can leverage SQL Server Management Studio or SSMA to import schema in PostgreSQL.
</br>

</br>

</br>

### **Migrate Data**

You need to choose migration approach for online migration or offline migration based on customer requirement and business condition.
Azure Data Factory can be used for ETL method for both migration method. Also, you can use SSMA for offline migration scenario.
</br>

</br>

</br>

### **Sync data and cut over**

In online (minimal-downtime) migrations, the migration source continues to change. It drifts from the target in terms of data and schema after the one-time migration.
</br>
During the Data sync phase, ensure that all changes in the source are captured and applied to the target in near real time. After you verify that all changes are applied, you can cut over from the source to the target environment.
</br>

In a delta/incremental migration that uses [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-factory/), for each table, use a query that filters (cuts) by date, time, or another parameter. Then finish the migration by using a second query that migrates the remaining data.
